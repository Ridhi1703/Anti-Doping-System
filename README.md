# 🚀 Anti-Doping System (AnuSutra) - Ensuring Fair Play in Sports 🏅

## 📄 Overview
The **Anti-Doping System** is an innovative platform designed to enhance the integrity of sports by leveraging advanced technologies to detect, investigate, and prevent doping violations. By integrating data from various sources, such as testing results, athlete biological passports, and wearables, we aim to provide a comprehensive solution for maintaining transparency, fairness, and trust in sports.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **🔍 Data Integration**: Aggregates data from testing results, biological passports, betting patterns, and other sources.
- **📊 Advanced Analytics**: Uses AI/ML algorithms to detect suspicious patterns and anomalies in performance and betting data.
- **🕵️‍♂️ Investigation Management**: Streamlines investigation with automated case tracking, evidence management, and reporting tools.
- **🔔 Timelined Data Visualization**: Displays a timeline of test results for athletes to enhance transparency.
- **⚙️ Athlete Behavioral Biometrics**: Analyzes performance metrics from wearables to detect potential doping cases earlier than traditional methods.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python (AI/ML), JavaScript (React.js for UI)
- **Frameworks**: Django (Backend), Node.js (API Development)
- **Database**: MongoDB (Storing athlete data, test results)
- **Anomaly Detection Algorithm**: Using **Isolation Forest** and **Local Outlier Factor (LOF).** algorithms for detecting unusual patterns in athlete performance and betting data.
- **Integration**: API integration with **IOC’s IBIS** and **NADA’s ABP** for real-time data access
- **Hosting**: AWS (Scalability and high performance)
- **Security**: AES and SSL/TLS encryption for data privacy

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Data Integration**: Centralizes all relevant data sources into a secure, unified system.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes AI/ML to detect patterns and deviations that could indicate doping.
3. **Actionable Insights**: Investigators can use the intuitive dashboard to gain insights and initiate actions.
4. **Transparency**: The timelined data visualization provides a comprehensive view of an athlete’s testing history, boosting transparency.
